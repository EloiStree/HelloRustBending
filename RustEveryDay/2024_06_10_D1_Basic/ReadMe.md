[https://youtu.be/769VqNup21Q](https://youtu.be/769VqNup21Q)  
- Expect long compile time
- Expect by binary type
- Rust app are just a bit binary of all the package loaded and your code that build in.
- C vs Rust:  https://youtu.be/NtYHC1KNGoc
  - All the world is 'C'
  - Rust is "operating system coding"
  - 


Memory file in Rust is possible ?
- Because I need to send big data from Unity to Rust and Rust to Unity

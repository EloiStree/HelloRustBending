Since you're encountering the build error on Windows, here are specific steps you can follow to resolve it:

1. **Install Rust:**
   Ensure that you have Rust installed. You can download and install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/). If you already have Rust installed, update it:
   ```sh
   rustup update
   ```

2. **Install Visual Studio Build Tools:**
   Make sure you have the Visual Studio Build Tools installed. You can download them from the [Visual Studio Build Tools page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). During installation, ensure you select the "C++ build tools" workload, which includes the necessary tools and libraries.

3. **Install Additional Dependencies:**
   You might need to install Lua and its development files. One way to do this is by using a package manager like [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
   cd vcpkg
   .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   .\vcpkg integrate install
   .\vcpkg install lua
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   Set the `CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_BUILD_OVERRIDE_DEBUG` environment variable to enable debug information generation:
   ```sh
   set CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_BUILD_OVERRIDE_DEBUG=true
   ```

5. **Build with Verbose Output:**
   Run the build command with verbose output to get more details about the failure:
   ```sh
   cargo build -vv
   ```

6. **Linking Lua Manually:**
   If the build script cannot find Lua, you may need to specify the path manually. Add the directory containing `lua.lib` to your `LIB` environment variable, and the directory containing `lua.h` to your `INCLUDE` environment variable.

   ```sh
   set LIB=C:\path\to\lua\lib;%LIB%
   set INCLUDE=C:\path\to\lua\include;%INCLUDE%
   ```

7. **Check the `build.rs` Script:**
   Examine the `build.rs` file in the `mlua-sys` crate if you can. This file contains custom build commands and might provide clues about what is failing. You can usually find this file in the crate's repository on GitHub or in your local `cargo` registry directory.

8. **Consult Documentation and Issues:**
   Visit the [mlua-sys GitHub repository](https://github.com/khvzak/mlua) and the [crates.io page](https://crates.io/crates/mlua-sys) for any specific instructions or known issues related to building on Windows.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the build failure with `mlua-sys` on Windows. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide the verbose error output from the build command for more specific troubleshooting.

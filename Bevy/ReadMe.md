I like Unity3D but... Rust is so ECS and Multit-hread ready type of language...  
That I can bet on it for my future incomine 20 years... When Unity3D. I don't know.  

I love the simplicity of Unity3D for create good face game.
But do I want my server to be in Unity ECS or Script Mono ...


I want to have fun creating game with 16k+ player in the same room. 
I have the feeling that Rust can offert that.
